📊 Analysis of Model Performance Your classification reports show imbalanced performance across different target variables. Let's break it down:

🔹 Troubles cardio-respiratoires Accuracy: 69% → Not bad, but we need to analyze class balance. Precision (Class 1): 1.00 → When the model predicts class 1, it's always correct. Recall (Class 1): 0.17 → Very low. The model is missing a lot of actual 1s. 💡 Issue: The model is biased toward class 0, detecting almost all 0s but missing most 1s.

🔹 Troubles cognitifs Accuracy: 75% → Looks okay at first glance. Recall (Class 1): 0.00 → The model never detects class 1 (serious issue). Precision (Class 1): 0.00 → When it predicts class 1, it's never correct. 💡 Issue: The model completely ignores class 1, meaning it fails to identify people with cognitive issues.

🔹 Troubles neurologiques Accuracy: 50% → Equivalent to random guessing. Precision (Class 1): 0.00 → Again, model fails to classify 1s. Recall (Class 1): 0.00 → Misses all 1s. 💡 Issue: Severe class imbalance—model is completely failing for positive cases.

🔹 Troubles cutanés/phanères Accuracy: 81% → Best result so far. Precision (Class 1): 1.00 → Perfect precision means no false positives. Recall (Class 1): 0.25 → Very low recall, meaning it detects very few positive cases. 💡 Issue: Even with high accuracy, the model struggles with 1s.

🛠️ Why Is This Happening? Severe Class Imbalance If most samples are 0, the model prefers predicting 0 to maximize accuracy. It results in very low recall for 1 (i.e., it misses most of them). Small Dataset (Only 16 Test Samples) Hard to make conclusions from such a tiny test set. A few misclassifications can make accuracy drop significantly.
